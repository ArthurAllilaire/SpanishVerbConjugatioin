# SpanishVerbConjugatioin
Python program that prints out all common conjugations of spanish verb infinitives that are put in with translation

To input verbs, just add them onto the tuple list at the top of the code and it will print, using selenium to scrape spanishdict.com and google translate API to translate results. Beautiful soup would be faster, but still hoping to be able to figure out how to scrape elements only visible on hover, as this would allow me to get examples as well. Only does 5 most common tenses, but with minor tweaks to code should be able to get all of them.

The Print output is able to then be copied and pasted into flashcrad software like Anki or Quizlet to easily make flashcards of verbs.
